intro: I successfully "build" a personal blog with Jekyll and Github Pages. Still it's not optimal. Besides someday I may move to Wordpress.

This is a "Hello World" blog for my new jekyll blog!

People say jekyll is easy to use. Well, compared to Wordpress, yes. But I still encountered some technical problems
when configuring all these things. Good news is, this blog is basically working now!

I'm considering moving everything from Google Sites to Github Pages. That means I still have many things to learn,
including assets management and designing my own layout.
